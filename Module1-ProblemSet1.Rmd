# Instructions

## How do I hand in these problems for the Thursday deadline?

Your complete Rmd file that you create for these practice problems AND the resulting pdf (i.e., the one you 'Knit to PDF' from your .Rmd file) must be uploaded into a Quercus assignment (link: [https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/253019/assignments/782402](https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/253019/assignments/782402)) by 11:59 a.m. ET, on Thursday, January 13th. Late problem sets are NOT accepted.


# Problem set grading

There are two components to your problem set. Part one is R based, there is one mandatory question in part 1 and some optional questions that are highly recommended to complete to help prepare you for larger assessments, but will not be graded on the weekly problem sets. Part two is more focused on writing. We recommend you use a word processing software like Microsoft Word to check for grammar errors in your written work. Note: there can be issues copying from Word to R Markdown so it may be easier to write in the RMarkdown file first and then copy the text to Word. Then you can make any changes flagged in Word directly in your RMarkdown file. (without using copy-paste)


# Part 1

## Question 1 [Required]

For this question we will work with data about the TV show Avatar: The Last Airbender. See the data description video on Quercus for more information and attributions:

### a) The name of the data set is `avatar.csv`. Load the data and save it under the name "avatar". 

```{r}
# Write your answer below


# Tip: don't forget to put quote marks around the name of the dataset inside the function
```

### b) We have learned two functions this week that let us quickly get an idea of our data. Apply both of them to the avatar data.

```{r}
# Write your answer below

```

### c) How many observations does the `avatar` data frame include? 

*Write your answer here*

### d) How many variables are measured for each observation? 

*Write your answer here*

### e) How many rows and columns does the `avatar` data frame have? 

*Write your answer here*

## Question 2 [Optional]

Below is a 'math square puzzle'. The value for each row and column is shown after the equals signs, but the operations are missing. The possible operations are: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

For example, if a row said 2 blank 7 = 14, we could figure out that blank has to be multiplication (*).

### a) Write out the equations below and assign them to the appropriate names. The first rows has been completed as an example.

![A math square puzzle](magic_square_W22.jpg)
```{r}
# Row 1 (r1)
r1 <- 6 + 4
  
# Row 2 (r2)

  
# Column 1 (c1)

  
# Column 2 (c2)


```

### b) Now, let's check you are right using what we've learned about logicals. Create a vector called `my_answers` in the order: rows 1 and 2 and then columns 1 and 2. Use the names you assigned, i.e. 'r1' and 'c2', not the numbers.

```{r}


```

### c) Create a numeric vector called `square_answers` with the values from after the equal signs from the math square above, i.e. 4, 6, 4, and 1, in that order.

```{r}


```


### d) Assign the name `check` to the result of this code: `square_answers == my_answers`. 

```{r}



```

### e) Which of the following best describes what `check` is?

  (i) A single value counting how many correct rows and columns you calculated.
  (ii) A numeric vector of the differences between the math square answers and your answers (should be all 0s if you got them all right).
  (iii) A character vector of 'TRUE' and 'FALSE', 'TRUE' for each answer that matches and 'FALSE' for any that don't.
  (iv) A logical vector of TRUE and FALSE, TRUE for each answer that matches and FALSE for any that don't.
  (v) A single logical value TRUE or FALSE, TRUE if all the values match, FALSE if any of the values don't match.



### f) Use the `sum()` function (and the fact of coercion) to get a single numeric value for the number of rows and columns you got right. If you got everything right your result should be 4.

```{r}


```

## Question 3 [Optional] 

In this question, you will consider another example of survivor bias. Music from earlier periods is often thought of as better than music now. To think of this as a general experiment, you could randomly select 10 songs on Spotify produced prior to Dec 31, 1999 and 10 songs on Spotify produced after Jan 1, 2000, and see which group has a higher average number of listens per song. 

### (a) Could this sample be non-representative of all songs/music?

*Write your answer here*


### (b) If the average number of listens is greater for the sample of older songs compared to newer songs, does this 'prove' old music is better than new?

*Write your answer here*

# Part 2 [Required]

**Writing prompt**:  

Identify one of the course learning objectives (from the syllabus) that you are most excited about. Describe why this objective is especially interesting to you.

### Some general reminders 

- Try to not send more than 20 minutes on the prompt. 

- Aim for more than 200 words but less than 500 words. 

- Use full sentences.  

- Grammar is *not* the main focus of the assessment, but it is important that you communicate in a clear and professional manner. I.e., no slang or emojis should appear. 

- Be specific. A good principle when responding to a writing prompt in STA130 is to assume that your audience is not aware of the subject matter (or in this case has not read the syllabus). Therefore, in this case, you need to properly communicate what the objective is putting it in your own words (paraphrasing). You should not just copy the learning objective and put it in quotation marks.
